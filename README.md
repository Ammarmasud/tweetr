# Tweeter Project

A simple single-page AJAX-based Twitter clone that uses jQuery, HTML5 and plain ol' CSS3 to help web bootcamp students get comfortable with their front-end chops with those technologies.

## Technical Approach & Objectives

The server is built with Node and Express and allows users to request and submit tweets via a JSON end-point. The server/express code should not require any change from the student.

Implemented the HTML, CSS and client-side JS to bring this project to life.

## Final Product

The end result looks and functions like this:
